Visualizes the data from the very first race of Max Verstappens F1 Career from 2015 with Toro Rosso, though to the present day with Aston Martin Red Bull Racing. 

The aim of the project is to find insights into the data to see if I can find correlations and try to predict future results given the data that is accumalated.
